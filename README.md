<a href="https://info.smartmessages.net/"><img src="https://www.smartmessages.net/img/smartmessages-logo.svg" width="250" height="28" alt="Smartmessages email marketing"></a>

This is an ASPX.NET client library and example code for the [smartmessages.net](http://info.smartmessages.net/) email management service's public API.

This library was contributed by a smartmessages.net customer - we are not ASPX experts, so can't offer much in the way of support.

Please feel free to suggest modifications, submit tickets and pull requests in [our github repo](https://github.com/Smartmessages/ASPCClient) - these libraries are intended to make YOUR life easier!

Documentation for the API can be found in [our help wiki](http://wiki.smartmessages.net/#API)
